# Poland-on-maps

Nice maps of Poland created with R and Python.

## About

I always wanted to create nice maps that I've seen all over the internet. From what I know most of them are done in Python and R

## Inspiration

Main inspiration was the Twitter(X) [30 day map challenge](https://twitter.com/hashtag/30DayMapChallenge) and all the beautiful and useful maps created by many people.

Next there was [Milos](https://twitter.com/milos_agathon) that created map of river basins of Poland and provide a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIOCVCxh2B8).

So I have place to start.

## Goals

With this project I want:
- Create beautiful and useful maps of Poland
- Learn where to find interesting data that can be presented on maps
- Learn Python and R
