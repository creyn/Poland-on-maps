Playing a little with hill-shading for Poland. But it looks not so good as Switzerland. The country is bigger and to get high resolution it takes a lot of data.

So skip for now and try to hill-shade something smaller. Like the highest mountain in Poland - Rysy (2499m).

I've found nice tool online for creating bounding-box to limit area: https://boundingbox.klokantech.com/ --> [Bounding Box bbox tool online](../Bounding%20Box%20bbox%20tool%20online.md)

I've chosen this are to map:

The bounding box can be in many formats. Let's take the "OGC WKT":
```
POLYGON((20.054124 49.202095, 20.118108 49.202095, 20.118108 49.159603, 20.054124 49.159603, 20.054124 49.202095))
```

> Well-known text (WKT) and well-known binary (WKB) are two encodings for simple feature geometries.

Now we need to convert it to the Simple Feature object.
