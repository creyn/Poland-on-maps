I've noticed that all my R scripts have similar beginning and end. I would like to put them into a reusable code that I can execute instead of copy-pasting the code.

I'll create my first [R package](../R%20package.md).

I've found that article: https://tinyheero.github.io/jekyll/update/2015/07/26/making-your-first-R-package.html. It is from 2015 but it might be a good place to start.

Well ... it wasn't ðŸ˜Š It turns out that since then the tool changed and the tutorial isn't working anymore.

But I use the [PyCharm IDE](../PyCharm%20IDE.md) after all and there is a new "R package" project type, so let's try this one.

Looks that it somehow worked:
