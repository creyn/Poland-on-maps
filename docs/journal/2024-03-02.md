I updated the tutorial [main](src/01-river-basins/main.R) script and so that it runs successfully on my laptop.

Interesting that on my old laptop it cannot finish run from Powershell but when run from [PyCharm IDE](docs/PyCharm%20IDE.md) it did finish but took about 2 hours and 25GB of disk space.

And the final image looks like this:

So the setup looks OK and now I can go and start from the scratch.

It looks like those lines produce a simple but quite nice map of Poland with all the rivers in the `Rplots.pdf` file:
```
plot(sf::st_geometry(country_sf), col = "red")
plot(sf::st_geometry(country_rivers), add = T)
```

![Rplots](src/01-river-basins/Rplots.pdf)

Looks easy enough to be my next step in learning how to map.
