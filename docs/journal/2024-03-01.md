Today the [100 commitow](https://100commitow.pl/) contest starts. I've signed up to learn some R and Python and create beautiful maps of Poland.

I will use [PyCharm IDE](../PyCharm%20IDE.md) that supports [Python language](../Python%20language.md) and [R language project](../R%20language%20project.md).

But first, let's run the tutorial from [Milos](../Milos.md): [Youtube - Create Stunning 3D River Basins in R using HydroSHEDS Data and rayshader](../inbox/Youtube%20-%20Create%20Stunning%203D%20River%20Basins%20in%20R%20using%20HydroSHEDS%20Data%20and%20rayshader.md)

Let's try to run [main](../../src/01-river-basins/main.R) in the [R language project](../R%20language%20project.md) environment.
