Today the [100 commitow](https://100commitow.pl/) contest starts. I've signed up to learn some R and Python and create beautiful maps of Poland.

I will use [[PyCharm IDE]] that supports [[Python language]] and [[R language project]].

But first, let's run the tutorial from [[Milos]]: [[Youtube - Create Stunning 3D River Basins in R using HydroSHEDS Data and rayshader]]

Let's try to run [[main.R]] in the [[R language project]] environment.
