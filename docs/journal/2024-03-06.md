Working on the containerisation of R scripts. I started with the `ubuntu` Docker image but looks like there is an official image for R env: https://hub.docker.com/_/r-base

But it does not have all packages that I need. And installing them from the script requires compilation from C++ code so a lot of time and resources needed.

There is another Docker image that I would try, the problem is that I am learning R so I don't know yet what packages would be required. But it could be sufficient for the beginning.

There is cool [Rocker project](../Rocker%20project.md) that maintain Docker images for different R related scenarios. Plus it runs [RStudio](../RStudio.md) out of the box so I can now easily play with R.

I will use the `rocker/geospatial:latest` image (https://rocker-project.org/images/versioned/rstudio.html).

Unfortunately pulling this part `116d1ca4cb5e71774dc3716bd922d958e9c383276e029c7f50b6c8fe05dfe8dd` of the image took too long so I decided to use another version of that image.

**Plus the image is 4.6 GB in size. So quite big one.**

# RStudio

To run the [RStudio](../RStudio.md) from the build image:
```bash
docker run --rm -ti -e PASSWORD=yourpassword -p 8787:8787 poland-on-maps
```

And go to the `http://localhost:8787` with the user `rstudio` and password `yourpassword`.

# Bash

To interact with R environment on the build image on Windows:
```bash
docker run -it -v ${PWD}:/home/docker -w /home/docker poland-on-maps bash
```

Now we can execute scripts that will create maps from/in the mounted folder (current folder)
```bash
Rscript src/02-Poland-borders/02-Poland-borders.R
```
