Wow, it is almost a month without maps for me. Quite a busy time. But I am back to it. Especially that we were on a bike trip on the Poland's coast and we did 280 km in 5 days and I want to put it on a map.

First, I have to download all activities from our trip from the Garmin website: https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activities.

I can use the script: [How to download KML files for activities in Garmin portal](../How%20to%20download%20KML%20files%20for%20activities%20in%20Garmin%20portal.md) but there are not that many activities so I will do it manually.

First version of the map:

Second version, with the 'cartolight' tiles:

Third version with 'cartodark' tiles:

Another with thinner line width:
