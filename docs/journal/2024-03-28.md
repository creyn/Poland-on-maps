Next interesting option with the run that I did is to see my own trail.

I have a `Garmin Venu 2S` smartwatch and you can download the [KML](../KML.md) data from Garmin website for each activity. There are other track file types but R can read KML quite easily. 

The Garmin KML file contains 3 layers, one have line with entire run. Another for example has list of all measure points. I'll use the single line to draw a map.

It looks like this:

I must say it is quite easy to draw a KML on a nice looking map using the [Leaflet](../Leaflet.md) package.
