Today I want to map all of my Garmin activities that have [KML](../KML.md) data. I can see that as of today I have 319 activities in the Garmin portal.

I can download KML files of all of them with the script [How to download KML files for activities in Garmin portal](../How%20to%20download%20KML%20files%20for%20activities%20in%20Garmin%20portal.md).

Some of them are not GPS driven activities (such as indoor gym). So I want to limit KMLs to map only to those with GPS.

So the final script is here: [10-Garmin-KML-on-map](../../src/10-Garmin-KML-on-map/10-Garmin-KML-on-map.R) and this is how my 260 activities looks on the map:

There are a lot of countries in Europe that I need to run or hike in ðŸ˜Š
