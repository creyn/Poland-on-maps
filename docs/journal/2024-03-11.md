After some admin tasks, let's go back to learning R.

There is a really nice [Tidyverse](../Tidyverse.md) project that is designed for [data science](../data%20science.md). They have interesting book with basics of R in that context called: [R for Data Science](../R%20for%20Data%20Science.md).

I think I would need some of that knowledge of importing, tidying and transforming different datasets to draw my maps.

One of maps I'm planning to create is the election results in Poland. And those are provided in the `csv` file.

So ... let's read the [R for Data Science](../R%20for%20Data%20Science.md) book.

OK wait ! 

I just think of a way how to get the `HYRIV_ID` for the Vistula river, the main river in Poland. In the first map from the tutorial ([01 - tutorial - river basins](../01%20-%20tutorial%20-%20river%20basins.md)) one of the datasets was [HydroSheds](../HydroSheds.md) which has list of all rivers in Europe. Each river has its own ID called `HYRIV_ID`. **But there is no search capability!**

The script filters rivers by the `bbox_wkt` filter which is set to a rectangle around Poland. So I just shrunken it so much that it contains only the Vistula river itself. 

The original `bbox_wkt`:
```R
bbox_wkt <- "POLYGON((  
    14.12290 49.00285,
    14.12290 54.83568,
    24.14544 54.83568,
    24.14544 49.00285,
    14.12290 49.00285))  
"
```

My shrunken version:
```R
bbox_wkt <- "POLYGON((  
    18.820263 54.154207,
    18.814122 54.197418,
    18.925752 54.199760,18.925752 54.154207,
    18.820263 54.154207))  
"
```

And the plot looks like this:

Those lines are actually 3 rivers:
```R
country_rivers <- sf::st_read(  
    filename,  
    wkt_filter = bbox_wkt  
)  
print(country_rivers)
```

![](../_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240311215907.png)

And all of them flows into one main river. Probably this is the Vistula river ID. Let's draw it.

```R
vistula_river <- country_rivers[country_rivers$HYRIV_ID %in% c("20265844"), ]
```

Nope. Looks like those 3 rivers are short local rivers and the `MAIN_RIV` is not the Vistula river. Looks like it doesn't flow into it. Maybe the shrunken bbox was wrong.

But let's find out what river is the longest one using the `LENGTH_KM` field.

Now when I look at that data structure it should be quite easy to find the most mentioned `MAIN_RIV` river in the first bbox. Or the longest river in Poland using the `LENGTH_KM` field.

Also wrong.

It turns out that there is no single ID that I can use to find the Vistula river as according to the documentation the entire network has separate IDs for each river sub-part.

Probably the longest path in that tree would be the Vistula river.

So I guess learning about R data structures in [R for Data Science](../R%20for%20Data%20Science.md) is a good next step ðŸ˜Š
