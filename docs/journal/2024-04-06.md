Let's upgrade the utils package a little bit. It should return object of created folders (like folders for data and output map).

Plus I need another utils for fetching datasets.

I'll use that updated package to map roads of Poland found in the [EnviroSolutions](../EnviroSolutions.md) dataset.

The full map looks like this (quite skewed):

That dataset has quite interesting types of roads:
```
[1] "residential"    "tertiary"       "secondary"      "service"       
 [5] "primary"        "living_street"  "unclassified"   "secondary_link"
 [9] "tertiary_link"  "trunk"          "primary_link"   "trunk_link"    
[13] "path"           "pedestrian"     "cycleway"       "footway"       
[17] "track"          "track_grade1"   "track_grade3"   "track_grade5"  
[21] "track_grade4"   "track_grade2"   "steps"          "unknown"       
[25] "bridleway"      "motorway_link"  "motorway"   
```

And this is the map of only the `primary` roads:

## Interesting

The [PyCharm IDE](../PyCharm%20IDE.md) is extremely resource consuming. For that dataset it was 10 GB page file on disk. And it didn't recover all after closing. Switching to Powershell.
