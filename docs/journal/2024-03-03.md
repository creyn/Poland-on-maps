The tutorial from [Milos](../Milos.md) went quite well and not it is time to start from the top.

Goal: map of Poland borders: [02 - Poland borders](../02%20-%20Poland%20borders.md)

Looks quite easy, especially that there are already libraries for fetching spatial structures for countries and the plot feature of [R language project](../R%20language%20project.md).

Nice discovery: [giscoR](../giscoR.md) and [gisco](../gisco.md).
