The hill-shade map of Rysy continuous.

I've changed the `plot` to `ggplot` drawing function as it is way better in my opinion. Plus it has more options to configure.

Using `ggplot` we can see how the `z` parameter in `get_elev_raster` changes the resolution.

And TBH looking at the topography map of elevation without additional information is difficult. There are no lakes for example. I have troubles with locating the Rysy.

If we compare the screenshot of a bounding box with a topography map it is clear we are missing some lakes and country borders:

There are however darker green areas where lakes should be. So later I'll try to add them.

Let's see how hill-shade looks like.

I can easily find lakes now ðŸ˜Š

Let's combine those two then...

And I think I like it more when the sun is in the North so we have shadows on the southern side.
