The Docker image works and anybody can create maps only by running:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/creyn/Poland-on-maps.git
cd Poland-on-maps
docker build -t poland-on-maps .
docker run -it -v ${PWD}:/home/docker -w /home/docker poland-on-maps bash
root:/home/docker# Rscript src/02-Poland-borders/02-Poland-borders.R
```

Now I want to rework existing scripts so we could provide folder for big datasets downloaded by scripts and make them nicer in general.

Now scripts ([02-Poland-borders](../../src/02-Poland-borders/02-Poland-borders.R) and [03-Poland-regions](../../src/03-Poland-regions/03-Poland-regions.R)) supports ENV variables for setting folders for downloaded datasets and final output maps.

## Supported ENV variables

`POM_DATA_FOLDER` - folder for downloaded datasets (`script-big-data` sub-folder in each script folder if ENV missing)
`POM_OUTPUT_MAPS_FOLDER` - folder for final output maps (each script folder if ENV missing)

Time to update [README](../../README.md)
