Today I've played more with the KML data. I am able to map KML files one by one but cannot do that in a list/vector/loop scenario. I want that scenario so I don't add all activities manually. 

...

OK I was able to do that simply creating the proper type of vector using the first KML file.

And this is how my 14 activities with KML look like on a map. From that zoom level they all looked like dots though.

Next map would be with all my activities that I can download from Garmin website.
