I would like to join couple things together. First: the border of Warsaw. Second: the Vistula river. Third: the tiles of actual map from some kind of map source.

The first two was already done in [05-Poland-Vistula-Warsaw](../../src/05-Poland-Vistula-Warsaw/05-Poland-Vistula-Warsaw.R)

For map tiles and `ggplot` I would use the `ggspatial` and `prettymapr` combination. It downloads map tiles and has easy integration with the `ggplot`.

The `zoom` level determines the resolution of the final map and number of downloaded tiles. For example `zoom = 13` is 132 tiles and `zoom = 10` is 16 tiles.

As we can see the shape file that I have for the Vistula river is just o line, it is not a real shape of the river.

Plus the tiles are downloaded and cached on disk:

And the final map:
