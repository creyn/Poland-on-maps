Today I want to focus on the tooling. I already have 3 maps generated: one from the tutorial and two simple maps with just the borders.

But for someone that don't know how to use Python / R it is difficult to run the code, play with it and generate maps.

I want to create a Docker file with options to just type `docker run` and specify where maps should be created. The entire script processing should be done in the container.
