Today I want to draw new map, about Poland main Vistula river. I've found new dataset in the [EnviroSolutions](../EnviroSolutions.md).

As reminder, to use Docker:
```bash
cd poland-on-maps
docker build -t poland-on-maps .
```
```bash
docker run -it -v ${PWD}:/home/docker -w /home/docker -e POM_DATA_FOLDER=/home/docker/data -e POM_OUTPUT_MAPS_FOLDER=/home/docker/output poland-on-maps bash
```
```bash
Rscript src/04-Poland-rivers/04-Poland-rivers.R
```

And the dataset seems to be OK. It has each rivers separated and each river has the length (the `DLUG` property). 

So to get the longest river:
```R
rivers <- sf::st_read(filename)  
rivers_ordered <- rivers[order(rivers$DLUG, decreasing=TRUE),]  
longest_river <- head(rivers_ordered, 1)
```

So this how the longest river in Poland (the Vistula river) looks like:

This is displayed in the core `plot` but now I've learned about the `ggplot` so this is how it looks like in `ggplot`:

It is much easier to plot with `ggplot` so it would be my default from now.

And I want to add the Poland borders to the map. I could add this from the [02 - Poland borders](../02%20-%20Poland%20borders.md) map.

This is the final map, Poland borders with the Vistula river:

Interesting:

This is how all rivers from that dataset looks like (this is with only rivers dataset so no borders, rivers also go outside of Poland):

Please also take a look at the meridians, how they are distorted when plotting single rivers vs plotting with borders (from another dataset):
