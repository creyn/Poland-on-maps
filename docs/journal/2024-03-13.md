Reading the [R for Data Science](../R%20for%20Data%20Science.md) book I've created new playground where I will run other scripts than the map ones.

The first script is [visualization](../../src/playground/R-for-data-science/visualization.R) where I will play with [ggplot2](../ggplot2.md).

There is this very important concept in both R and tidyverse [philosophy that missing values should never silently go missing](../philosophy%20that%20missing%20values%20should%20never%20silently%20go%20missing.md).

Following the chapter on visualisation I was able to draw this nice diagram for the example penguins dataset:
