Looks like scripts can be run from the Docker container. It is time to publish this image to [Docker Hub](../Docker%20Hub.md).

First, lets create a new repository: https://hub.docker.com/r/creyn/poland-on-maps

Second, lets tag the image: 
```bash
docker tag poland-on-maps creyn/poland-on-maps
```

Third, lets login to docker in the cmd:
```bash
docker login
```

```bash
Log in with your Docker ID or email address to push and pull images from Docker Hub. If you dont have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com/ to create one.
You can log in with your password or a Personal Access Token (PAT). Using a limited-scope PAT grants better security and is required for organizations using SSO. Learn more at https://docs.docker.com/go/access-tokens/

Finally, lets push the image to remote repository:
```bash
docker push creyn/poland-on-maps
```

```
Using default tag: latest
The push refers to repository [docker.io/creyn/poland-on-maps]
