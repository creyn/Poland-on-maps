Fun with election results continue...

I had to merge two different datasets. They have column with the same ID from the [TERYT](../TERYT.md) system, only in a different format.

So first, mutate to have common column:
```r
voivodeships_with_teryt <- voivodeships |>  
    mutate(  
       kod_teryt = paste(JPT_KOD_JE, "0000", sep = "")  
    )
```

And then merge on that column:
```r
merged <- merge(voivodeships_with_teryt, results_voivodeships_with_winner, "kod_teryt")
```

And the final map of results per voivodeship:

I've found nice website that offers cool maps of Poland: https://wbdata.pl/blog/

A lot of inspiration for myself.
