OK it is enough playing with Garmin KML data. Now let's go back to other maps.

The most important file format that I've seen is [SHP file format](../SHP%20file%20format.md) and every one is different, have different features.

So I've created a script that let's me play a little and take a look at an [SHP file format](../SHP%20file%20format.md) file.

[glimpse-shp](../../src/playground/glimpse-shp.R)

The first function is to see summary of file with the [glimpse](../glimpse.md) function. Plus there is a [view function](../view%20function.md) that shows searchable and sort-able table with all the data in the [PyCharm IDE](../PyCharm%20IDE.md):

And sometimes it is easier to map with [ggplot2](../ggplot2.md) and sometimes with [Leaflet](../Leaflet.md).
