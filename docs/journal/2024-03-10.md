Today small admin work. I need a place for list of all datasets.

For now, there is only 3 scripts:
- [main](../../src/01-river-basins/main.R)
- [02-Poland-borders](../../src/02-Poland-borders/02-Poland-borders.R)
- [03-Poland-regions](../../src/03-Poland-regions/03-Poland-regions.R)

From those there are 2 main datasets:

Rivers and basins:
[HydroSheds](../HydroSheds.md)

Poland regions:
[GIS Support PL](../GIS%20Support%20PL.md)

And all of those can be found here: [Public datasets](../Public%20datasets.md)
