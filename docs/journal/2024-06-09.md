After my very first bike trip I already want to have two more. I want to also make a map and a list of:
- Castles in Poland
- Vineyards in Poland

But for now, there is one thing I always wanted to learn: the [Rayshader](../Rayshader.md)

Let's find some nice tutorials. Probably from [Milos](../Milos.md).

I've found this one: xxx

There is a dataset for population density for Poland: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/kontur-population-poland

Unfortunately, [Rayshader](../Rayshader.md) is very resource consuming and on my old laptop it is very time consuming for rendering `render_highquality` even for small 300x200 images ðŸ˜¯

So I use the `render_snapshot` which is much faster.

Also nice repo to check: https://github.com/h-a-graham/rayvista

The Poland's population density map with [Rayshader](../Rayshader.md) looks like this:

Now, I want to try this with elevation map of Poland.
