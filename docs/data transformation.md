Use [dplyr](dplyr.md) package, a part of [Tidyverse](Tidyverse.md).

```r
glimpse(some_dataset)
View(some_dataset)
```

>abbreviations that tell you the type of each variable: `<int>` is short for integer, `<dbl>` is short for double (aka real numbers), `<chr>` for character (aka strings), and `<dttm>` for date-time. These are important because the operations you can perform on a column depend so much on its “type”.
