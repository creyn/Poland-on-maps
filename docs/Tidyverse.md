The tidyverse is an opinionated [collection of R packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages) designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

There is a book [R for Data Science](R%20for%20Data%20Science.md)

Plus the [ggplot2](ggplot2.md) comes from here.
