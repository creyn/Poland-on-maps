>**rayshader** is an open source package for producing 2D and 3D data visualizations in R. **rayshader** uses elevation data in a base R matrix and a combination of raytracing, hillshading algorithms, and overlays to generate stunning 2D and 3D maps. In addition to maps, **rayshader** also allows the user to translate **ggplot2** objects into beautiful 3D data visualizations.
>The models can be rotated and examined interactively or the camera movement can be scripted to create animations. Scenes can also be rendered using a high-quality pathtracer, **rayrender**. The user can also create a cinematic depth of field post-processing effect to direct the user’s focus to important regions in the figure. The 3D models can also be exported to a 3D-printable format with a built-in STL export function, and can be exported to an OBJ file.
