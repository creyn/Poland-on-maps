Dplyr functions (**verbs**) have the 1st argument a **data_set**. So we can use the [R pipe operator](R%20pipe%20operator.md): `|>` 

2nd argument usually is the column name to operate on.

The output is always a new [Data frame](Data%20frame.md)

dplyr’s verbs are organized into four groups based on what they operate on: **rows**, **columns**, **groups**, or **tables**.

```
There’s a useful shortcut when you’re combining `|` and `==`: `%in%`
```
